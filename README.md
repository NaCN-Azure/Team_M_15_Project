- update the frame of our project
- I decide to divide our project into three parts(just a first draft)
- Directory "database" contains the files which connects to the databases also with the methods and configs in it. 
- Directory "pages" is what we mainly coding with, like the logging pages, main pages, register pages or map pages etc., that will depend on our meetings in the future
- Directory "images" contains some images that we may use to decorate our Front Pages
- Otherwise, If there's any questions, just talk on Whatspp or Team, 
- Or if somebody want to update his or her codes, just pull it and merge it, and you can add commit information in README.md just like I did.

- update the login.page(using ttkbootstrap based on tkinder)
- login only contains the element, no events here, still needs interfaces or services on it
- before run the data, you must use pip install package **ttkbootstrap** and **pytkUI** first!!!
